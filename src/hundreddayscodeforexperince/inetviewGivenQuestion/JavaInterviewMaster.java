 * 1.what is difference between forEach method and for each loop?
 * The terms "forEach method" and "for-each loop" might seem similar, but they refer to different concepts in Java:
 *
 * forEach Method:
 * The forEach method is a higher-order function introduced in Java 8 as part of the Stream API.
 * It is used to perform an operation on each element of a collection (like a List, Set, or Map) or a stream.
 * It takes a lambda expression or a method reference as an argument, which defines the action to be performed on each element.
 * The forEach method is often used in a pipeline of stream operations to process elements in a functional and concise manner.
 * Example:
 * java
 * Copy code
 * List<String> names = Arrays.asList("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");
 * names.forEach(name -> System.out.println("Hello, " + name));
 * For-Each Loop (Enhanced for Loop):
 * The for-each loop, also known as the enhanced for loop, is a control structure introduced in Java 5.
 * It provides an easy and concise way to iterate over elements of an array or collections (including arrays, Lists, Sets, etc.).
 * It simplifies the process of iterating over elements by abstracting away the index management.
 * It does not require explicit initialization, condition, or increment statements.
 * Example:
 * java
 * Copy code
 * int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
 * for (int num : numbers) {
 *     System.out.println(num);
 * }
 * In summary, the forEach method is used with streams to perform an operation on each element in a collection or stream, while the for-each loop is a control structure for iterating over elements of an array or collections in a more concise manner. The choice between them depends on the context and the capabilities you need.

 * 2.what is meaning by name(String...args)
 * In Java, the String... args syntax is used to define a method parameter that can accept a variable number of arguments of type String. This is commonly seen in the main method of a Java program, which is the entry point for executing the program.
 *
 * Here's what each part of String... args means:
 *
 * String: This specifies the data type of the arguments that the parameter can accept. In this case, it's String type arguments.
 * ...: This is called the ellipsis or varargs syntax. It indicates that the parameter can accept multiple values of the specified data type. It allows you to pass an arbitrary number of arguments separated by commas.
 * args: This is the name of the parameter. You can choose any valid variable name. It's the name you will use within the method to refer to the array of arguments.
 * For example, in the main method, String... args allows you to provide command-line arguments when running the Java program. These arguments will be collected into an array named args, which you can then access and process within the method.

 *
 * 5.what is volatile keyword?
 * The volatile keyword in Java is used to indicate that a variable's value may be changed by multiple threads simultaneously. It ensures that reads and writes to the variable are directly performed on the main memory, preventing thread-specific cached copies.
 *
 * When a variable is declared as volatile, any thread that reads the variable will see the most recent value written by any other thread, avoiding inconsistencies due to caching. However, it does not guarantee atomicity for compound operations like incrementing or checking.
 *
 * Using volatile is suitable when a variable is accessed by multiple threads and its value can change outside the control of the program, such as when it's modified by hardware or other external factors.
 *
 * While volatile provides visibility guarantees, it doesn't provide synchronization for compound actions, so atomicity and complex thread synchronization require additional mechanisms like locks or other synchronization constructs.

 * 6.In git if we have multiple commit but i want to make all commit into single commit what's being command for that?
 *
 * If you have multiple commits that you want to combine into a single commit in Git,
 * you can use an interactive rebase to squash or fixup the commits. Here's how you can do it:
 *
 * Open a terminal or command prompt.
 * Navigate to the repository where you want to combine the commits.
 * Run the following command to start an interactive rebase:
 *
 * git rebase -i HEAD~n
 *
 *
 * Replace n with the number of commits you want to combine, minus 1.
 * For example, if you have 5 commits to combine, use git rebase -i HEAD~4.
 * An editor will open with a list of your recent commits. Each commit line will start with the word pick.
 * Change the word pick to squash or s for the commits you want to combine into the previous commit.
 * If you want to discard a commit completely, you can change pick to fixup or f.
 * Save and close the editor.
 * Another editor will open where you can edit the commit message. You can keep the message of the first commit or edit it to create a new message.
 * Save and close the editor.
 * Git will now combine the selected commits into a single commit. If you used squash, it will also prompt you to edit the commit message.
 *
 * Please note that rewriting history using interactive rebase can be risky,
 * especially if you're working in a collaborative environment or if you've already pushed the commits to a remote repository.
 * It's a good practice to avoid rewriting history of already pushed commits, as it can cause confusion for other contributors.

 * git log --since="7 days ago"
 * git log --since="7 days ago" --oneline
 * git log --since="7 days ago" --pretty=format:"%h - %an, %ar : %s"
 *
 *
 * 8.what is difference between for loop and for each loop?
 * The "for loop" and the "for-each loop" (also known as the enhanced for loop) are both constructs in Java used for iteration, but they have some differences in terms of syntax and use cases:
 *
 * For Loop:
 * The traditional for loop is a control structure used for iterating over a sequence of values, commonly used with arrays and when a specific range of indices is needed.
 * It consists of initialization, condition, and increment/decrement statements.
 * It provides more control over the iteration process, including the ability to define custom index increments and conditions.
 * Example:
 * java
 * Copy code
 * for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
 *     System.out.println(array[i]);
 * }
 * For-Each Loop (Enhanced for Loop):
 * The for-each loop is designed to simplify iteration over elements in collections (arrays, Lists, Sets, etc.).
 * It abstracts away the index management and simplifies the iteration syntax.
 * It automatically iterates through each element of a collection without requiring an explicit initialization, condition, or increment statement.
 * It is more concise and often used when you just need to process each element in a collection without worrying about indices.
 * Example:
 * java
 * Copy code
 * for (ElementType element : collection) {
 *     System.out.println(element);
 * }
 * In summary, the choice between a traditional for loop and a for-each loop depends on your specific use case. Use a for loop when you need more control over the iteration process, and use a for-each loop when you want a cleaner and more concise way to iterate through elements in collections.
